            Sounds from external environments that do not align with the rhythmic patterns of the internal human
            environment can trigger the "fight or flight" response, leading to the release of stress hormones such as 
            adrenaline and cortisol, resulting in elevated blood pressure.
          </p>
          <p class="lorem-ipsum-has">
            Prolonged exposure to these hormones, without any real danger present, can be detrimental to health. 

          </p>
          <p class="when-an-unknown">
            Furthermore, the pleasurable sensations induced by loud music, such as relaxation and sedation, due to the release of endorphins, 
            contribute to the tendency of individuals to listen to music incessantly for extended periods, eventually leading to addiction. 
          </p>
          <p class="it-has-survived">
            Excessive reliance on music as a coping mechanism or source of entertainment may lead to social isolation, as individuals may
            prioritize solitary listening experiences over social interactions. 
          </p>
          <p class="it-was-popularised">
            This can hinder the development of meaningful relationships and contribute to feelings of loneliness and isolation.

                  Research conducted jointly by the National Institute for Physiological 
                  Sciences in Japan and the University of Muenster in Germany has demonstrated 
                  the harmful effects of prolonged exposure to loud music on ear and brain nerves, 
                  resulting in hearing loss.

                  Additionally, Neuroendocrinologist Dr. Robert Sapolsky from Stanford University 
                  explains how stress hormones direct blood glucose away from the brain's hippocampus, 
                  impairing memory recall and cognitive functions.

                  In addition to the previously discussed consequences, prolonged exposure to loud music can also have 
                  significant impacts on various aspects of life, including sleep quality, social interactions, educational 
                  productivity, and mood regulation.
